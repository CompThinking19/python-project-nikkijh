The code currently runs without error, which is what we're looking for here, but there's a bit of distance to go before its output matches your expectations. It's not totally clear to me what that output is suppose to be at this point. Obviously, you're going for a madlibs generator, but you're not yet getting user input, so it's not clear to me what the user's role is in the program and what you hope to do with it. Remember the importance of comments that say why, as this would give some clarity.
